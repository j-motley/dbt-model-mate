## 1. Overview

dbt Model Mate is a VS Code extension built on a feature plugin architecture. The system is designed around two equally important constraints: any team member should be able to add new functionality by following a simple, repeatable pattern, while the architecture must support robust capabilities over time without requiring that pattern to change.

The extension activates when a `dbt_project.yml` is detected in the workspace, indicating a dbt project is open.

## 3. Core Layer

### 3.1 Feature Interface

Every capability in the extension implements the `Feature` interface. This is the only contract contributors need to understand.

```typescript
interface Feature {
  readonly id: string;           // matches the VS Code command ID
  readonly displayName: string;  // shown in logs and error messages
  activate(services: ServiceContainer): Contribution[] | Promise<Contribution[]>;
  run?(services: ServiceContainer, input?: unknown): Promise<FeatureResult>;
  deactivate?(): void | Promise<void>;
}

interface Contribution {
  disposable: vscode.Disposable;
}
```
==It is important to note that a "Feature" in this document, for this codebase, refers exclusively to a unit of VS Code extension functionality — not to semantic model features or dbt features.==

Some features build project context (scanning the codebase, generating context documents), while others consume it (generating semantic models, validating references). This distinction is conceptual and not part of the core feature contract — all features implement the same interface.

### 3.2 FeatureRegistry

`FeatureRegistry` iterates `allFeatures`, calls `activate()` on each, collects the returned disposables, and manages their lifecycle. If a feature fails to activate, the error is logged and surfaced as a notification — other features continue activating.

### 3.3 ServiceContainer

`ServiceContainer` is the dependency injection boundary. Features receive a `ServiceContainer` instance and call services through it. They never import services directly or instantiate them. This keeps features isolated from infrastructure details and fully testable with mock services.

```typescript
interface ServiceContainer {
  ai: AiService;
  aiProfiles: AiProfileService;
  dbtProject: DbtProjectService;
  workspace: WorkspaceService;
  diagnostics: DiagnosticsService;
  contextStore: ContextStoreService;
  vscodeContext: vscode.ExtensionContext;
}
```

### 3.4 Feature Registration

The only file contributors edit to register a new feature is `src/features/index.ts`:

```typescript
export const allFeatures: Feature[] = [
  new GenerateContextDocumentsFeature(),
  new GenerateSemanticModelFeature(),
  new GenerateContextualSemanticModelFeature(),
];
```
## 3.5 Feature Execution Model

Features in dbt Model Mate are not only user-facing commands — they are also composable execution units.

### Purpose

The Feature Execution Model enables:
- programmatic feature invocation
- feature-to-feature composition
- reusable workflows
- future agent-like orchestration

It does **not** introduce a separate agent framework, planner, or workflow engine. It is a minimal execution abstraction.

### Invocation Paths

A feature may be invoked by:
- a VS Code command (user-triggered)
- another feature (programmatic execution)
- future workflow or orchestration systems

### FeatureRunner

Programmatic execution is handled through a shared runner:

```typescript
interface FeatureRunner {
  run(featureId: string, input?: unknown): Promise<FeatureResult>;
}
```

`FeatureRunner` is responsible for:
- resolving a feature by its `id`
- verifying that the feature supports programmatic execution via `run()`
- invoking the feature with shared services and optional input
- returning a structured `FeatureResult`

### Relationship to `Feature`

A feature has two distinct responsibilities:

- `activate()` registers VS Code contributions
- `run()` performs programmatic execution and returns a structured result

`FeatureRunner` uses `run()` and never calls `activate()`.

### FeatureResult

```typescript
interface FeatureResult {
  success: boolean;
  data?: unknown;
  artifacts?: Artifact[];
  error?: string;
}
```

### Artifact Model

```typescript
interface Artifact {
  type: 'semantic_model' | 'context_doc' | 'report' | 'analysis';
  path?: string;
  content?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

### Execution Principles

- Features remain isolated
- No direct feature-to-feature imports
- All execution goes through FeatureRunner
- Side effects allowed, but structured output encouraged

## 4. Service Layer

### 4.1 AiService

`AiService` is the interface all features use for AI calls. The implementation is `DelegatingAiService`, which reads the active profile from `AiProfileService` at call time and routes to the appropriate provider implementation.

```typescript
interface AiService {
  complete(prompt: string, options?: AiOptions): Promise<string>;
  stream(prompt: string, onChunk: (chunk: string) => void, token?: vscode.CancellationToken): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Provider implementations:**

| Provider | Class | Authentication |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Copilot | `CopilotAiService` | VS Code `vscode.lm` API — uses active GitHub session |
| Anthropic | `AnthropicAiService` | API key from `SecretStorage` |
| OpenAI | `OpenAiService` | API key from `SecretStorage` |

The `DelegatingAiService` selects the correct implementation based on `profile.provider`. Features never interact with provider implementations directly.

**Error types:**
- `AiProfileNotConfiguredError` — no active profile is set
- `AiProfileUnavailableError` — active profile exists but cannot complete the call (auth failure, model unavailable, etc.)

Both errors propagate to the feature, which is responsible for user-facing handling. The `StatusBarManager` provides a shared `handleAiError()` helper for consistent error display.

### 4.2 AiProfileService

Manages named AI provider profiles. Profiles are stored in VS Code `settings.json` (non-sensitive fields only). API keys are stored separately in VS Code `SecretStorage` under a key derived from the profile ID.

```typescript
interface AiProfileService {
  getProfiles(): AiProfile[];
  getActiveProfile(): AiProfile | null;
  setActiveProfile(id: string): Promise<void>;
  addProfile(profile: AiProfile, apiKey?: string): Promise<void>;
  removeProfile(id: string): Promise<void>;
  getApiKey(profileId: string): Promise<string | undefined>;
  onDidChangeActiveProfile: vscode.Event<AiProfile | null>;
}
```

**Profile switching behavior:** Profile switching is always user-initiated. The extension never automatically switches profiles or falls back to an alternative on failure. If the active profile becomes unavailable, the user is notified and presented with explicit choices: switch, retry, or configure.

### 4.3 DbtProjectService

Parses the dbt project at the open workspace root. YAML source files are the primary data source. `target/manifest.json` is used as an optional enrichment layer when present, adding compiled column types and descriptions without being required.

**Startup detection sequence:**
1. Locate `dbt_project.yml` at workspace root
2. Parse project name, version, model paths, and `require-dbt-version`
3. Check version compatibility (warn if below 1.7.0)
4. Glob for model YAML files under configured model paths
5. Parse semantic model definitions from all YAML files
6. If `target/manifest.json` exists, layer in column type and description enrichment

```typescript
interface DbtProjectService {
  detect(): Promise<DbtProjectInfo | null>;
  getModels(): Promise<DbtModel[]>;
  getSemanticModels(): Promise<SemanticModel[]>;
  findModelByName(name: string): Promise<DbtModel | null>;
}
```

### 4.4 ContextStoreService

Manages context documents in `.dbt_model_mate/context/` within the workspace. Each document is a markdown file with a machine-readable JSON header on the first line:

```
<!-- dbt-model-mate {"id":"<uuid>","type":"<type>","generatedAt":"<iso>"} -->

# Document content...
```

The UUID is assigned at write time using `crypto.randomUUID()`. It is stable for the lifetime of that document version — writing a new version assigns a new UUID.

```typescript
interface ContextStoreService {
  write(type: ContextDocumentType, content: string): Promise<ContextDocument>;
  read(type: ContextDocumentType): Promise<ContextDocument | null>;
  readAll(): Promise<ContextDocument[]>;
  isStale(type: ContextDocumentType, thresholdHours?: number): Promise<boolean>;
  getAvailableTypes(): Promise<ContextDocumentType[]>;
}
```

**Supported document types:**
`architecture` | `naming_conventions` | `source_index` | `pattern_library` | `governance_index` | `product_catalog`

### 4.5 WorkspaceService

Wraps VS Code workspace and Node `fs` APIs. Resolves all paths relative to the first workspace folder root. Features never access the file system directly.

### 4.6 DiagnosticsService

Wraps `vscode.languages.createDiagnosticCollection`. Features post and clear diagnostics through this service rather than managing their own collections.

---

## 5. Context Document Provenance

When a feature generates output using context documents, it prepends a provenance block identifying which documents were used and when:

```yaml
# Generated by dbt Model Mate
# generated: 2026-03-22T10:35:00Z
# context:
#   architecture: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
#   naming_conventions: 7c9e6679-7425-40de-944b-e07fc1f90ae7
#   source_index: a87ff679-a2f4-471d-8308-d78985433cb4

semantic_models:
  ...
```

This allows any generated file to be traced to the exact context state that produced it. If context documents are subsequently refreshed (new UUIDs assigned), the generated file can be identified as potentially stale.

---

## 6. AI Integration

### 6.1 Context Documents as Manual RAG

Context documents implement manual Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Rather than a vector store performing semantic retrieval, the extension injects curated, pre-computed summaries of the dbt project into the AI prompt. The AI reads them as part of the prompt and produces output consistent with the team's conventions.

This approach is simpler than full RAG infrastructure and more reliable for focused use cases — the extension controls exactly what context the AI receives. The natural evolution path is to chunk the context documents into a vector store as the project grows, or to serve them via an MCP server for dynamic retrieval.

### 6.2 Context Window Management

Each feature is responsible for staying within model context limits. The current approach:
- Context documents are injected whole — typically 5–20 KB each
- Features select which document types are relevant to their task rather than injecting all documents
- Prompt templates are designed to be concise, not exhaustive

Future work: a `contextBudget` concept in `AiOptions` to track and warn on token load before calling.

### 6.3 System Prompts vs Context Documents

Both go into the AI call but serve different purposes:

| | System prompt | Context documents |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Shape how the AI behaves | Teach the AI about this specific project |
| **Content** | Role, output format, behavioral rules | Architecture, conventions, patterns, indexes |
| **Scope** | Universal across all projects | Project-specific |
| **Updated** | When feature logic changes | When the project changes |

---

## 7. UI Components

### 7.1 Status Bar

Two persistent status bar items, always visible when the extension is active:

| Item | Content | Click action |
|---|---|---|
| AI provider | `⚡ [profile name] · [model]` | Opens profile picker |
| dbt project | `$(database) [project name]` | — |

**Warning states:**
- No profile: `$(alert) Configure AI`
- Profile unavailable: `$(warning) [profile name] unavailable`
- Incompatible dbt version: warning indicator on dbt project item

### 7.2 Profile Picker

A `vscode.window.showQuickPick` listing all configured profiles with the active profile marked. Invoked by clicking the AI provider status bar item or via `dbtModelMate.selectAiProfile`.

### 7.3 Inline UI (within features)

Features use standard VS Code UI APIs directly:
- `showQuickPick` — model selection, document type selection
- `withProgress` — progress notification during AI calls
- `showInformationMessage / showWarningMessage / showErrorMessage` — results and errors with action buttons

### 7.4 Planned UI Surfaces

| Surface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Workflow panel (tree view) | Show available features with staleness indicators on context documents |
| Architecture guidance panel | Show AI architectural recommendations for the active model |
| AI usage panel | Show current model, token consumption, remaining credits |

## 9. CI Pipeline

Three jobs run on every push and pull request to `main` and `develop`:

| Job | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `npm run lint` | ESLint with TypeScript rules |
| Type Check | `tsc --noEmit` | Strict TypeScript validation |
| Test | `npm test` (headless) | Unit tests with mock services |
| Package | `vsce package` | Validates the extension builds as a `.vsix` |

The package job runs only after lint, typecheck, and test pass. The `.vsix` artifact is uploaded and retained for 14 days.
